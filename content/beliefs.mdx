- It's more important to find the 100 books that will change your life than to read 100 books every year. 
- First impressions matter. It's important to eat healthy, have a sleep routine, and rest properly. 
- Optimism is severely underrated. On a long enough time span, it matters less what happened than how you perceived it. 
- The wedding is an event, love is a practice. The graduation is an event, education is a practice. The race is an event, fitness is a practice.The heart, mind, and body are endless pursuits.
- It's more fun to be a fan than a critic. Cynicism is easy, optimism is not. 
- Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
- Gratitude is incredibly important. A daily gratitude practice can yield immense satisfaction. 
- Always keep the main thing the main thing. 
- In life, you may not always have a map, but as long as your compass is pointed in the right direction, you will end up in the right place.
- Spend more time in the sun. Vitamin D is most absorbed through sunlight. 
- Visit tropical parts of the globe if you can. The sun, waves, and weather are almost always worth it.
- Never bet against your cultural roots. Learn your mother language, understand its history, and its traditions.
- Always play the long game. Being positive-sum is good for the world at large. 
- The best way to change the world is in concentric circles: start with yourself and work your way out from there.
- When in doubt, always simplify. Simple is usually always better. 
- Be silly. The world needs more whimsy.
- Always give when you can. Helping patients on Watsi is the most fulfilling birthday gift. 
- Relax. Always believe that life is conspiring in your favor. 
- In the end, only three things matter: how much you loved, how gently you lived, and how gracefully you let go of things not meant for you.
